He is a trained physiotherapist and certified at the highest level in the neurac (Neuromuscular Activation) treatment method and has previously educated and certified physiotherapists internationally, as well as being a member of the Norwegian Teaching Group associated with this community. Sandvikmoen has some experience as a former project manager in connection with the development and patenting of training equipment and as a contributor to several master's theses and Springbrett for Connect Norge. He has also worked as a consultant for Redcord and been involved in testing and developing the Stimula treatment device, as well as contributing to the development of the Neurac treatment method. Sandvikmoen developed a special exercise for activating the innermost core muscle, the Iliopsoas. The exercise was given the resounding name \"Sandvikmoen\" and is used internationally by physiotherapists.",
        "bio2": "We believe that the expertise of the team / advisory board and project manager helps to ensure the quality of the development of the CoreCapacity method. The team of contributors that has now been assembled and tested, including through pilot research, makes us confident that we can achieve our goals, and it reduces the risk regarding further development work. We feel that we can source the most important and necessary expertise for this project in Norway and in Kristiansand, but we also draw on resources and expertise from abroad when necessary.",
