Sandvikmoen has some experience as a former project manager in connection with the development and patenting of training equipment and as a contributor to several master's theses and Springbrett for Connect Norge. He has also worked as a consultant for Redcord and been involved in testing and developing the Stimula treatment device, as well as contributing to the development of the Neurac treatment method. Sandvikmoen developed a special exercise for activating the innermost core muscle, the Iliopsoas. The exercise was given the resounding name \"Sandvikmoen\" and is used internationally by physiotherapists.",
